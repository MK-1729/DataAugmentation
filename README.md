# DataAugmentation

This program creates more variations of datasets for training your deep learning models. This was inspired by the types of geometric or photometric data augmentations that will lead to better model accuracy and performance.There are a few type of operations that are performed such as:

# Geometric Operations

# 1.Rotation

Can be set find out the rotations of images whether clockwise or counter clockwise.

# Photometric Operations

# 1. Color Jittering 

Manipulates the color channels of the images by introducing noises to each channel.

# 2. PCA ( Soon to come )

Raw implementation of reducing the dimensions of the data to the simplest form.
